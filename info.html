This template was made to help develop new applications. It also has the purpose of defining a base line for the development of addons, in order to maintain the coherence between the pages as much as possible..<br>
Each Addon is embedded in ochin_web but is self-contained. Except for the topbar and some general libraries (jquery and bootstrap) which are part of the main framework, the addon contains everything it needs (specific libraries, databases, images etc ..)
<h5>What does this addon do</h5>
This addon shows an example table. By means of the "+" button located at the top right of the same, it is possible to add a new empty row to the table. <br>
On the right side of each row there are two buttons: "Edit" and "Delete". With the first button it is possible to insert and modify the data of the row, while with the second button it is possible to delete the entire row. <br>
All the data inserted in the table are written inside a sqlite3 database. It is created the first time the addon is started in the "db" subfolder. The table is updated at each page refresh requesting all the data from the database.
